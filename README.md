# icinga2

This repository contains the source for the [icinga2](https://www.icinga.org/icinga2/) [docker](https://www.docker.com) image.

The dockerhub-repository is located at [https://hub.docker.com/r/jordan/icinga2/](https://hub.docker.com/r/jordan/icinga2/).

This build is automated by push for the git-repo. Just pull it via:

    docker pull jordan/icinga2

Latest version: 2.15.0

## Usage

Start a new container and bind to host's port 80

    docker run -p 80:80 -h icinga2 -t jordan/icinga2:latest

### docker-compose

Clone the repository and create a file `secrets_sql.env`, which contains the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` variable.

    git clone https://github.com/jjethwa/icinga2.git
    cd icinga2
    echo "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<password>" > secrets_sql.env
    docker-compose up

This boots up an icinga(web)2 container with another MySQL container reachable on [http://localhost](http://localhost) with the default credentials *icingaadmin*:*icinga*

### Persistence

To ensure restarts, you should set:

`DEFAULT_MYSQL_PASS`  - The database password for the icinga2 user

`MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` - This is the root (admin) password for the database.  The container will try to reset the password for the icinga2 database user if this is available

This is particularly important when using the /var/lib/mysql volume or an external database

## Icinga Web 2

Icinga Web 2 can be accessed at [http://localhost/icingaweb2](http://localhost/icingaweb2) with the credentials *icingaadmin*:*icinga* (if not set differently via variables).  When using a volume for /etc/icingaweb2, make sure to set ICINGAWEB2_ADMIN_USER and ICINGAWEB2_ADMIN_PASS

### Saving PHP Sessions

If you want to save your php-sessions over multiple boots, mount `/var/lib/php/sessions/` into your container. Session files will get saved there.

example:
```
docker run [...] -v $PWD/icingaweb2-sessions:/var/lib/php/sessions/ jordan/icinga2
```

## Graphite

The graphite writer can be enabled by setting the `ICINGA2_FEATURE_GRAPHITE` variable to `true` or `1` and also supplying values for `ICINGA2_FEATURE_GRAPHITE_HOST` and `ICINGA2_FEATURE_GRAPHITE_PORT`. This container does not have graphite and the carbon daemons installed so `ICINGA2_FEATURE_GRAPHITE_HOST` should not be set to `localhost`.

Example:

```
docker run -t \
  --link graphite:graphite \
  -e ICINGA2_FEATURE_GRAPHITE=true \
  -e ICINGA2_FEATURE_GRAPHITE_HOST=graphite \
  -e ICINGA2_FEATURE_GRAPHITE_PORT=2003 \
  jordan/icinga2:latest
```

You will need to modify the retention policy as detailed here: https://github.com/jjethwa/icinga2/issues/275#issuecomment-1046892058

## Icinga Director

The [Icinga Director](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-director) Icinga Web 2 module is installed and enabled by default. You can disable the automatic kickstart when the container starts by setting the `DIRECTOR_KICKSTART` variable to false. To customize the kickstart settings, modify the `/etc/icingaweb2/modules/director/kickstart.ini`.

## API Master

The container gets automatically configured as an API master. But it has some caveats. Please make sure:

- Set the container's hostname (`-h` or `hostname`)
  - The hostname has to match the name, your sattelites are configured to access the master.
- Forward the `5665` port
- Mount **both** volumes: `/etc/icinga2`, `/var/lib/icinga2`

## Sending Notification Mails

The container has `msmtp` installed, which forwards mails to a preconfigured SMTP server (MTA).

The full documentation for [msmtp is found here](https://marlam.de/msmtp).

You have to edit the file `msmtp/msmtprc` for general configuration and `msmtp/aliases` (mapping from local Unix-user to mail-address). Please note that the example file can be heavily changed and secured, so read the msmtp docs listed above

```
# msmtp/msmtprc
defaults
auth           on
tls            on
tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
logfile        /var/log/msmtp.log
aliases        /etc/aliases

# Gmail
account        gmail
host           smtp.gmail.com
port           587
from           <your-email-address@gmail.com>
user           <your-email-address@gmail.com>
password       <your-password-or-eval-command-to-gpg-file>

# Set a default account
account default: gmail
```

*Note that Gmail has become very restrictive, the preparation and config must be done in Gmail's settings. If you can't get it to work, consider another SMTP service*.

`msmtp/aliases` follows the format: `Unix-user: e-mail-address`.

```
# msmtp/aliases
root:<YOUR_MAILBOX>
default:<YOUR_MAILBOX>
```

As a last config change, edit the `data/icinga/etc/icinga2/conf.d/users.conf` and change the e-mail address `root@localhost` to either `root` or a valid external address. This must be done as msmtp interprets all addresses with an at-sign as external and the transport will fail. If the address is changed to `root` the aliasing feature will use your root alias instead.

These files have to be mounted into the container. Add these flags to your `docker run`-command:

```
-v $(pwd)/msmtp/aliases:/etc/aliases:ro
-v $(pwd)/msmtp/msmtprc:/etc/msmtprc:ro
```

If you are using the `docker-compose` file, uncomment the settings for these files under the icinga2 node and rebuild.


## SSL Support

For enabling of SSL support, just add a volume to `/etc/apache2/ssl`, which contains these files:

- `icinga2.crt`: The certificate file for apache
- `icinga2.key`: The corresponding private key
- `icinga2.chain` (optional): If a certificate chain is needed, add this file. Consult your CA-vendor for additional info.

For https-redirection or http/https dualstack consult `APACHE2_HTTP` env-variable.

## Custom CA Support

In the case where you need to trust a non-default CA, add the certificate(s) as `.crt` files to a volume to be mounted at `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/`.

Any certificates that are CA certificates with a `.crt` extension in that volume will automatically be added to the CA store at startup.

# Adding own modules

To use your own modules, you're able to install these into `enabledModules`-folder of your `/etc/icingaweb2` volume.

# MySQL connections

The container has support to run a MySQL server inside or access some external resources. By default, the MySQL server inside the container is setup, but when using the `docker-compose.yml` project, the server is located inside an extra container. Future releases will have this as the default and require an external MySQL/MariaDB container.

If you use the image plain or the `docker-compose.yml` project, you don't have to worry about anything for MySQL. Only, if you want to split the container from the MySQL server, it's necessary to give some variables.

## External MySQL servers

If you have the image running plain or use the `docker-compose.yml` project, there is no necessity to fool around with these variables.

To connect the container with the MySQL server, you have fine granular control via environment variables. For every necessary database, there is a set of variables, which describe the connection to it. In theory, the databases could get distributed over multiple hosts.

All variables are a combination of the service and the property with the format `<SERVICE>_MYSQL_<PROPERTY>`, while

- `<SERVICE>` can be one of `ICINGA2_IDO`, `ICINGAWEB2`, `ICINGAWEB2_DIRECTOR`
- `<PROPERTY>` can be one of `HOST`, `PORT`, `DATA`, `USER`, `PASS`

The container creates all databases for you by default, but you can skip this auto creation for each of the three databases.
By creating the databases yourself you won't have to provide the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` and it improves overall security and flexibility.

The variables default their respective `DEFAULT` service variable.

- `DEFAULT_MYSQL_HOST`: The server hostname (defaults to `localhost`)
- `DEFAULT_MYSQL_PORT`: The server port (defaults to `3306`)
- `DEFAULT_MYSQL_DATA`: The database (defaults to *unset*, the specific services have separate DBs)
    - `ICINGA2_IDO_MYSQL_DATA`: The database for icinga2 IDO (defaults to `icinga2idomysql`)
    - `ICINGAWEB2_MYSQL_DATA`: The database for icingaweb2 (defaults to `icingaweb2`)
    - `ICINGAWEB2_DIRECTOR_MYSQL_DATA`: The database for icingaweb2 director (defaults to `icingaweb2_director`)
- `DEFAULT_MYSQL_USER`: The MySQL user to access the database (defaults to `icinga2`)
- `DEFAULT_MYSQL_PASS`: The password for the MySQL user. (defaults to *randomly generated string*) - It is recommended that you set this value to ensure container restarts work as expected.
- `ICINGA2_IDO_MYSQL_SKIP_DB_CREATION`: This can be set to true if you already created the IDO database (defaults to `false`)
- `ICINGAWEB2_MYSQL_SKIP_DB_CREATION`: This can be set to true if you already created the Icingaweb2 database (defaults to `false`)
- `ICINGAWEB2_DIRECTOR_MYSQL_SKIP_DB_CREATION`: This can be set to true if you already created the Director database (defaults to `false`)

Note: Please do not use special chars like ! in mysql user/password because it breaks your director database connection. The director authentication.ini cannot handle it.


## Moving to separate MySQL-container

1. Start your current container as always.
1. Run `docker exec <container> i2-port-mysqldb`
1. Shutdown the container
1. Copy the MySQL datafolder from the `icinga2` container to your new `mariadb` container.
1. Change the environment variable `DEFAULT_MYSQL_HOST` to point to your new MySQL container.
1. Add the environment variable `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` to the icinga2 container, with the value of your password you currently set.
1. Start your container**s**.
